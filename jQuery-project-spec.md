Final project!

Open the skeleton and check out the console. 

Create a web page that asks the user what color they'd like to view the web page in. We have a few choices to start with, but feel free to add more. Note - if you want to add more color choices you might have to update both the prompt and the condition inside the while loop.

Keep asking until they enter a valid input (hint: You can end the while loop manually using the break keyword)

Use jQuery to resize the images on the page so they look cooler than they do now. 

Use jQuery to display a message letting the user know what color has been applied to the page.

Also feel free to change the content inside of the divs - these are just placeholders!

Use jQuery to add some new html elements to the page that don't exist yet!

use some effects on the divs that you have created using jQuery effects like the ones below:

$('h1').show() - convenience method to set element's 'display' property to 'block'
$('p#secret').hide() - set element's 'display' property to 'none'
$('ol li').fadeIn() - fade in a set of matched elements over time
$('p .comments').fadeOut() - fade out as set of matched elements over time
$('div#thing').slideDown() - animate an element sliding down over time
$('#message').slideUp() - animate an element sliding up over time
$('.alert').slideToggle() - toggle between an element sliding up or down over time depending on whether it's visible or not
